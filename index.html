        <h2>1) Who is this paper for and why read it?</h2>
        <p>
          This paper is useful for privacy researchers, product teams, policy designers, security
          practitioners, and anyone building AI-powered digital services.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It explains where AI agents can reduce privacy burden for users.</li>
          <li>It helps teams identify practical use cases for privacy automation.</li>
          <li>It frames current opportunities and limitations in one place.</li>

        <h2>2) Why use AI agents for privacy management?</h2>
        <p>
          Privacy decisions are frequent, complex, and hard to maintain over time. AI agents can
          assist users by turning high-friction privacy tasks into guided, continuous support.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Automate repetitive privacy settings and permission checks.</li>
          <li>Adapt recommendations to context, behavior, and user preferences.</li>
          <li>Provide clearer explanations and real-time decision support.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="user-excitement">
        <h2>3) User excitement about this direction</h2>
        <p>
          Users are often excited by privacy tools that save time while increasing confidence and
          control.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Easier privacy management with less manual effort.</li>
          <li>Personalized suggestions that match individual privacy comfort levels.</li>
          <li>Better awareness of hidden privacy trade-offs in daily app usage.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="alerts">
        <h2>4) Alerts we need to be aware of</h2>
        <p>
          Strong benefits come with critical risks. Privacy agents must be designed with safety,
          transparency, and accountability in mind.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Over-reliance: users may trust incorrect or biased agent recommendations.</li>
          <li>Data exposure: agents themselves process sensitive personal information.</li>
          <li>Opacity: unclear reasoning can reduce trust and make audits difficult.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="future-challenges">
        <h2>5) More privacy challenges that unfold</h2>
        <p>
          As AI agents scale, new challenges emerge beyond current privacy controls and policy
          models.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Governance and regulation for autonomous privacy decisions.</li>
          <li>Cross-platform consistency and interoperability of privacy preferences.</li>
          <li>Long-term alignment between user intent and agent behavior.</li>
